A React project I made for my own sake while there was an one week break from university. This projects is made 70% for revision purposes and 30% cause there is a small ambition in the future that this project is going to shine bright through AI and image recognition.Revision topics were some of the oldest stuff I learned through a React course such as .map() method and problems with the implementation of such a method in the way I wanted objects to be presented a specific way(.splice() method and a good colleague helped a lot). React Router was also a feature-package that I wanted to import in my App so that I could get used to multiple page applications for bigger projects in the future. Through this website I also wanted to practice transitions and media queries in CSS.This app was inspired by how the Blackjack counting-cards algorithm worked and how simple it was , yet there was no app or webpage designed to help people remember the count of cards with no flaws. More on how to use the app can be found on the "How to use" page.
